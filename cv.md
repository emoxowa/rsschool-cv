### Code example

**KATA from CODEWARS:** _Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering. Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number. The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between._

```javascript
var number = function (array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    array[i] = `${i + 1}: ${array[i]}`;
  }
  return array;
};
```
